### What Are Vanilla Gift Cards?

Vanilla Gift Cards are prepaid cards that function similarly to debit or credit cards. They are issued by Visa or Mastercard and can be used anywhere these cards are accepted. Available in fixed or customizable amounts, Vanilla Gift Cards make for a convenient gift or alternative payment option. However, as they are prepaid, they require proper activation before use.

#### Features of Vanilla Gift Cards:

- Accepted at millions of merchants globally.
- No credit check or personal details required.
- No monthly fees after purchase.

### Does Amazon Accept Vanilla Gift Cards?
